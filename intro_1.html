        <h4 class="blog-intro">what are microplastics?</h4>
        <p class="blog-text">
            Plastic is the most prevalent type of marine debris found in our ocean and Great Lakes. Plastic debris can
            come in all shapes and sizes, but those that are less than five millimeters in length (or about the size of
            a sesame seed) are called “microplastics.”
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
            Microplastics come from a variety of sources, including from larger plastic debris that degrades into
            smaller and smaller pieces. In addition, microbeads, a type of microplastic, are very tiny pieces of
            manufactured polyethylene plastic that are added as exfoliants to health and beauty products, such as some
            cleansers and toothpastes. These tiny particles easily pass through water filtration systems and end up in
            the ocean and Great Lakes, posing a potential threat to aquatic life.

        <h4 class="blog-intro">Microplastics detected in human blood</h4>
        <p class="blog-text">
            Microplastic pollution was identified in the blood of nearly 80% of the persons examined in a study
            supported by the Dutch National Organization for Health Research and Development. Plastic particles were
            discovered in 17 of 22 anonymous donors' blood samples, which were obtained with steel syringe needles and
            glass tubes to avoid contamination. PET plastic was found in half of the samples, while polystyrene from
            food
            packaging was found in a third, and polyethene, which is used to make plastic carrier bags, was identified
            in a quarter.

        <h4 class="blog-intro">Effect on human health</h4>
        <p class="blog-text">
            Microplastics surround us and human exposure can occur through inhalation, ingestion, and dermal absorption
            due to their omnipresence in air, water, food, and consumer products.
            Scientists think we may ingest anywhere from dozens, to more than 100, 000 microplastic particles each day
            as a useful visual it could be around the mass of a credit card's worth in the space of a year. Some studies
            have revealed that even the synthetic clothing we wear can shed fibers textiles to be the major
            source of airborne microplastics.

        <p class="blog-text">
            No research has yet been done to directly study the effects of microplastics on people. The research
            available so far either exposes human cells or tissues to microplastics or has investigated animals, such as
            mice or rats, as part of the study.
            Using the data that is available then, it is believed that microplastics may be hazardous to our health. It
            is thought they might act as irritants, in much the same way asbestos fibers are now known to inflame the
            lungs and cause cancer. Microplastics are also thought to act as vectors for microorganisms and toxic
            chemicals, thus posing further health risks.
            Research has shown the potentiality for metabolic disturbance, neurotoxicity as well as carcinogenic
            effects. It has been shown that microplastics can act as endocrine disruptors, thus interfering with normal
            hormone function and potentially causing weight gain.

            Certain microplastics, for example, flame retardants, are thought to interfere with fetal brain development,
            and likewise, they can affect normal brain development in children.

        <h4 class="blog-intro">Effect on marine life</h4>
        <p class="blog-text">
            Countless numbers of marine organisms are at risk of swallowing or getting entangled in an enormous amount of plastic waste dumped in the water, and what attracts species to interact with plastic in the oceans is still a confounding aspect. One of the speculating factor might be the way plastic resembles food such as plastic bags are mistaken for jelly fish. A study on sea turtles reveals that aquatic species are not only drawn to plastic waste by how it appears, but also by how it smells. Plastic debris get covered with algae and other microorganism after several days in the oceans that they start to scent like food. Sea turtles react to airborne olfactory receptors originating from bio-fouled plastics in the similar manner they react to food odors, so the places where plastic wastes are concentrated can act as olfactory traps that can drive the attention of other species and can be harmful.
